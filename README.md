# odin-todolist
This project was part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> Javascript curriculum.
I was instructed to recreate a Todo List using HTML, CSS, and JS.

The todo list functions as any other todo list. For my todo list, I didn't separate the todos into their own project arrays, I opted to use one array holding all of the todos. In order to filter through the todos using the sidebar nav, I would use arrays.filter on the central todos array.<br>

<br>For the projects, I also used an array but only held project names in them in order to display them from localStorage. 

<p>This project was meant to demonstrate my use of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML and CSS design</li>
  <li>Use of Webpack</li>
  <li>ES6 Modules</li>
  <li>localStorage</li>
  <li>Node.js libraries</li>
</ul>

## Objectives
<ol>
  <li>Create a todo</li>
  <li>Add a todo to specific project</li>
  <li>Delete a todo</li>
  <li>Filter through todos</li>
</ol>

## Needed Features
<p>For my todo list, every todo has "..." at the end of the todo to symbolize an edit button. However, I haven't implemented an edit function for that button yet.</p>
